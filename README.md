<h3>Elements of Neuronal Systems</h3>
<p>Biological research has amassed a huge amount of specific knowledge about the anatomy and function of the brain during the last century. Neurons are the basic processing units of the central nervous system, and they are intricately related to one another. In Fig. 1.1, a small piece of such a network of neurons is depicted in a picture by Ram√≥n y Cajal, one of the pioneers of neuroscience in the early 1900s. This image can only show a small portion of the cortex's neuronal network. Cortical neurons and their connections are really packed into a dense network with over 104 cell bodies per cubic millimeter and several kilometers of 'wires.' The wiring layout in different parts of the brain may appear to be distinct. Neurons of all sizes and forms, on the other hand, are the fundamental constituents in all domains. </p>
